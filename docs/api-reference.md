## Error Code Reference

Soroban contract errors are emitted as numeric enum discriminants. Error names
and values are scoped to each contract, so the same numeric value can mean
different things depending on which contract returned it.

### router-core `RouterError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the router has already been initialized. | Treat initialization as complete, or deploy a fresh contract if you need a new admin. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Admin-only helpers are called before `initialize` has stored the admin. | Initialize the router before calling configuration or admin reads. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the stored router admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `RouteNotFound` | 4 | A route or alias lookup targets a name that is not registered. | Register the route, check spelling, or remove stale aliases in the caller. |
| `RoutePaused` | 5 | `resolve` targets a route that has been individually paused. | Unpause the route or route traffic elsewhere. |
| `RouterPaused` | 6 | `resolve` is called while the global router pause is active. | Wait for recovery or have the admin call `set_paused(false)`. |
| `RouteAlreadyExists` | 7 | Registering a route or alias with a name that is already in use. | Choose a unique name or update/remove the existing route first. |
| `InvalidRouteName` | 8 | A route name is empty or only whitespace. | Send a non-empty, trimmed route name. |
| `InvalidMetadata` | 9 | Route metadata exceeds limits: description over 256 characters or more than 5 tags. | Shorten the description or reduce the tag list before submitting. |
| `RouteExpired` | 10 | `resolve` targets a route whose TTL ledger has been exceeded, or `extend_route_ttl` targets a route that has already expired. | Re-register the route, or call `extend_route_ttl` before expiry next time. |

### router-registry `RegistryError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the registry has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh registry for a new admin. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Admin-dependent registry operations run before initialization. | Initialize the registry before writes or admin reads. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the registry admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `NotFound` | 4 | No entry exists for the requested name/version, or no version satisfies a lookup. | Register the contract or adjust the requested name, version, or constraint. |
| `AlreadyRegistered` | 5 | The same `(name, version)` pair is registered twice. | Use a new version or deprecate old entries instead of overwriting. |
| `AlreadyDeprecated` | 6 | `deprecate` targets an entry that is already deprecated. | Treat the operation as already complete or choose another version. |
| `InvalidVersion` | 7 | Version is `0` or not greater than the current highest version for the name. | Use a positive version greater than existing versions. |
| `VersionNotFound` | 8 | `deprecate` targets a version that is not registered for the name. | Check `versions(name)` and retry with an existing version. |
| `InvalidConstraint` | 9 | A semver constraint cannot be parsed or uses an unsupported form. | Use exact, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `^`, or `~` constraints. |
| `AllVersionsDeprecated` | 10 | Lookup finds versions, but every matching entry is deprecated. | Register a newer active version or allow deprecated versions in the caller logic. |

### router-access `AccessError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the access contract has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh access contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Admin or role checks require the super-admin before it is stored. | Initialize the contract with a super-admin first. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller lacks super-admin or role-admin authority for the action. | Use an authorized signer or grant the required admin role first. |
| `AlreadyHasRole` | 4 | `grant_role` targets an address that already holds the role directly. | Treat as success, wait for expiry, or revoke before granting again. |
| `RoleNotFound` | 5 | `revoke_role` targets an address without that direct role grant. | Check `has_role` or role member lists before revoking. |
| `Blacklisted` | 6 | A blacklisted address is granted or checked for role access. | Unblacklist the address before granting roles. |
| `CannotBlacklistAdmin` | 7 | The caller tries to blacklist the super-admin address. | Transfer super-admin first, or choose another target. |
| `HierarchyCycle` | 8 | Setting a role admin would create a parent-role cycle. | Pick a role-admin hierarchy that does not point back to itself. |

### router-middleware `MiddlewareError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after middleware has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh middleware contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Middleware configuration or admin reads run before initialization. | Initialize the contract before route configuration. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the middleware admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `RateLimitExceeded` | 4 | A caller has used all allowed calls for the route's current window. | Retry after the window resets or raise the configured limit. |
| `RouteDisabled` | 5 | `pre_call` runs against a route whose middleware config is disabled. | Enable the route or bypass it intentionally. |
| `MiddlewareDisabled` | 6 | Global middleware enforcement is disabled. | Re-enable middleware or treat the route as temporarily unavailable. |
| `InvalidConfig` | 7 | Rate limiting is enabled with `max_calls_per_window > 0` but `window_seconds == 0`. | Set a positive window or set `max_calls_per_window` to `0` for unlimited calls. |
| `CircuitOpen` | 8 | The route's circuit breaker is open after repeated failures. | Wait for the recovery window, reset the breaker, or fix the failing downstream route. |

### router-timelock `TimelockError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the timelock has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh timelock contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Timelock operations need the admin or delay before initialization. | Initialize the timelock with an admin and minimum delay. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the timelock admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `NotFound` | 4 | `execute` or `cancel` targets an unknown operation id. | Recompute the operation id or query the operation before acting. |
| `NotReady` | 5 | `execute` is called before the queued operation's ETA. | Wait until the ETA has passed. |
| `AlreadyExecuted` | 6 | `execute` or `cancel` targets an operation that has already executed. | Treat it as complete and avoid replaying the operation. |
| `Cancelled` | 7 | `execute` or `cancel` targets an operation that has been cancelled. | Queue a new operation if the action is still needed. |
| `DelayTooShort` | 8 | `queue` uses a delay lower than the configured minimum delay. | Use at least `min_delay()` seconds. |

### router-multicall `MulticallError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after multicall has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh multicall contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Batch execution or admin reads require config before initialization. | Initialize the contract with an admin and batch size. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the multicall admin for configuration changes. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `BatchTooLarge` | 4 | `execute_batch` receives more calls than `max_batch_size`. | Split the batch or increase `max_batch_size`. |
| `EmptyBatch` | 5 | `execute_batch` is called with no calls. | Provide at least one call descriptor. |
| `RequiredCallFailed` | 6 | A required call in the batch fails. | Inspect per-call results, fix the failed required call, or mark it optional if safe. |
| `InvalidConfig` | 7 | `max_batch_size` is set to `0`. | Configure a positive maximum batch size. |

## router-core

**Contract:** `RouterCore`  
**Purpose:** Central dispatcher — registers routes by name and resolves them to contract addresses.

### `initialize(admin: Address) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Sets up the admin, marks the router as unpaused, and resets the total-routed counter.  
Must be called exactly once before any other function.

**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CORE_ID> --network testnet --source admin \
  -- initialize --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS>
```

---

### `register_route(caller, name, address) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Registers a new route. `name` must be unique and non-empty. Caller must be admin.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteAlreadyExists`, `NotInitialized`, `InvalidRouteName` (empty/whitespace)

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CORE_ID> --network testnet --source admin \
  -- register_route --caller <ADMIN> --name oracle --address <CONTRACT_ID>
```

---

### `update_route(caller, name, new_address) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Updates an existing route to point to a new address. Emits `route_updated` and `route_overwritten` events.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteNotFound`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `register_route_with_ttl(caller, name, address, ttl_ledgers: Option<u32>) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Registers a new route like `register_route`, but with an optional time-to-live. When `ttl_ledgers` is `Some(n)`, the route expires `n` ledgers from the current ledger sequence number; `resolve` then returns `RouteExpired` and `get_all_routes` excludes it. `None` registers a permanent route, identical to `register_route`.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteAlreadyExists`, `NotInitialized`, `InvalidRouteName`

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CORE_ID> --network testnet --source admin \
  -- register_route_with_ttl --caller <ADMIN> --name beta-integration --address <CONTRACT_ID> --ttl_ledgers 100000
```

---

### `get_route_expiry(name) → Option<u32>`
Returns the expiry ledger sequence number for `name`, or `None` if the route does not exist or has no TTL (permanent).

---

### `extend_route_ttl(caller, name, additional_ledgers: u32) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Extends a route's TTL by `additional_ledgers`. If the route already has a TTL, the new expiry stacks on top of the existing one; if the route is permanent, it gains a TTL of `additional_ledgers` ledgers from now. Must be called before the route expires.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteNotFound`, `RouteExpired` (route has already lapsed), `NotInitialized`

---

### `remove_route(caller, name) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Deletes a route and removes any aliases pointing to it.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteNotFound`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `resolve(name) → Result<Address, RouterError>`
Resolves a route name (or alias) to its contract address. Increments `total_routed`.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CORE_ID> --network testnet --source any \
  -- resolve --name oracle
```

---

### `set_route_paused(caller, name, paused: bool) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Pauses or unpauses a specific route.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteNotFound`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `set_paused(caller, paused: bool) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Pauses or unpauses the entire router. Overrides individual route state.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `get_route(name) → Option<RouteEntry>`
Returns the full `RouteEntry` for `name`, or `None` if not registered.

---

### `get_all_routes() → Vec<String>`
Returns all registered, non-expired route names. Routes whose TTL has lapsed are excluded.

---

### `add_alias(caller, existing_name, alias_name) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Creates an alias for an existing route. Resolving the alias returns the original route's address.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteNotFound` (existing_name), `RouteAlreadyExists` (alias_name)

---

### `remove_alias(caller, alias_name) → Result<(), RouterError>`
Removes an alias.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RouteNotFound`

---

### `total_routed() → u64`
Returns the cumulative count of successful `resolve` calls.

---

### `admin() → Result<Address, RouterError>`
Returns the current admin address.

**Errors:** `NotInitialized`

Transfers admin to a new address. Emits `admin_transferred`.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotInitialized`

---

## router-registry

**Purpose:** Versioned address book — stores contract addresses keyed by `(name, version)`.

### `initialize(admin) → Result<(), RegistryError>`
**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`

---

### `register(caller, name, address, version: u32) → Result<(), RegistryError>`
Registers a contract entry. `version` must be > 0 and greater than all existing versions for `name`.

### `get_latest_with_constraint(name, constraint: Option<String>) → Result<ContractEntry, RegistryError>`
Returns the highest non-deprecated version matching a semver constraint (`>=X`, `<=X`, `>X`, `<X`, `^X`, `~X`, or exact).

**Errors:** `NotFound`, `InvalidConstraint`

---

### `deprecate(caller, name, version: u32) → Result<(), RegistryError>`
Marks a version as deprecated. Deprecated versions are skipped by `get_latest`.

**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`

---

### `grant_role(caller, role, target, expires_at: Option<u64>) → Result<(), AccessError>`
Grants `role` to `target`. `expires_at` is an optional ledger sequence number after which the role expires. Caller must be super-admin or role admin.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `AlreadyHasRole`, `Blacklisted`

---

### `revoke_role(caller, role, target) → Result<(), AccessError>`
Revokes `role` from `target`. Removes the storage key (not just sets to false).

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `RoleNotFound`

---

### `has_role(role, target) → bool`
Returns `true` if `target` holds `role` and it has not expired. Returns `false` for blacklisted addresses.

---

### `set_role_admin(caller, role, admin) → Result<(), AccessError>`

---

## router-quote

**Contract:** `RouterQuote`
**Purpose:** Read-only quote previews for single-hop and multi-hop routes, including expected output, fees, slippage bounds, and a fixed-point exchange rate.

### `get_quote(router_core, route_name, token_in, token_out, amount_in, fee_bps, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`
Returns a quote for one liquidity plugin route. The call previews the swap result only; it does not execute a transfer.

**Errors:** `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `InvalidRoute`, `RouteNotFound`, `QuoteFailed`

---

### `get_multihop_quote(hops, amount_in, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`
Returns an end-to-end quote for an ordered route of liquidity plugin hops. The `amount_out` from each hop becomes the `amount_in` for the next hop.

**Errors:** `EmptyRoute`, `RouteTooLong`, `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `QuoteFailed`

---

### Quote Precision And Rounding

`exchange_rate` is returned as a fixed-point integer instead of a floating-point decimal:

```text
exchange_rate = floor(amount_out * 10^precision / amount_in)
```

`precision` is the number of decimal places encoded in `exchange_rate`. The contract accepts precision values from `1` through `18`; `6` is the typical default for UI and API clients.

For tokens with the same decimal count, convert the returned value to a human-readable rate like this:

```text
display_rate = exchange_rate / 10^precision
```

For tokens with different decimal counts, adjust for token base units:

```text
display_rate = (exchange_rate / 10^precision) * 10^(token_in_decimals - token_out_decimals)
```

Example with equal token decimals:

| `amount_in` | `amount_out` | `precision` | `exchange_rate` | Display rate |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `1_000000` | `2_000000` | `6` | `2_000000` | `2.000000` |
| `3_000000` | `1_000000` | `6` | `333333` | `0.333333` |

Rounding is deterministic and always truncates toward zero because Soroban integer division is used. The contract does not round up fractional remainders, so clients should treat the value as a floor estimate of the exact rate. Fee amounts and `min_amount_out` use the same integer-division behavior:

```text
fee_amount = floor(amount_in * fee_bps / 10_000)
min_amount_out = floor(amount_out * (10_000 - slippage_bps) / 10_000)
```

For UI display, keep the integer values for transaction decisions and apply formatting only at the presentation layer. For comparisons, compare fixed-point integers at the same `precision` rather than converting through floating-point numbers.

---

## router-middleware

**Contract:** `RouterMiddleware`  
**Purpose:** Pre/post call hooks with rate limiting and circuit breaker.

### `initialize(admin) → Result<(), MiddlewareError>`
**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`

---

### `configure_route(caller, route, max_calls_per_window, window_seconds, enabled, failure_threshold, recovery_window_seconds) → Result<(), MiddlewareError>`

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `InvalidConfig` (window_seconds=0 with max_calls>0), `NotInitialized`

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <MIDDLEWARE_ID> --network testnet --source admin \
  -- configure_route \
  --caller <ADMIN> --route oracle/get_price \
  --max_calls_per_window 100 --window_seconds 3600 \
  --enabled true --failure_threshold 5 --recovery_window_seconds 300
```

---

---

### `transfer_admin(current, new_admin) → Result<(), MiddlewareError>`
**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotInitialized`

---

### Rate Limiting Algorithm

#### How It Works

The rate limiter uses a **fixed-window counter** per `(route, caller)` pair.
Each caller has its own independent window — windows are not shared or aligned
across callers.

**Window lifecycle:**

1. On the first call, `window_start` is set to the current ledger timestamp
   and `calls_in_window` is set to 1.
2. Subsequent calls within the same window increment `calls_in_window`.
3. When `calls_in_window >= max_calls_per_window`, `pre_call` returns
   `RateLimitExceeded` and increments `total_violations` without counting
   the call.
4. On the first call after `window_start + window_seconds` has elapsed, the
   window resets: `window_start = now`, `calls_in_window = 1`.

The check in `pre_call`:
```
window_elapsed = now >= window_start + window_seconds
calls           = 0               if window_elapsed else calls_in_window
window_start    = now             if window_elapsed else window_start
```

#### Ledger Timestamp Granularity

Stellar closes a ledger approximately every **5 seconds**. All calls within
the same ledger closure share the same `env.ledger().timestamp()` value. This
means:

- A `window_seconds = 60` window allows all calls within the same 5-second
  ledger to be counted as a single moment. Setting `max_calls_per_window = 10`
  does **not** prevent 10 calls in the same ledger.
- For burst protection, set `window_seconds` smaller than 1 ledger close time
  only if you want to block multiple calls per ledger (they will all see the
  same `now` and the first call sets the window, subsequent ones within the
  same ledger see `window_elapsed = false`).

#### Tuning Guidelines

| Traffic pattern | Suggested config | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Low-traffic route | `max_calls=10, window_secs=60` | 10 calls per minute per caller |
| High-traffic route | `max_calls=1000, window_secs=300` | 1000 calls per 5 minutes per caller |
| Burst protection | `max_calls=5, window_secs=5` | 5 calls per 5-second ledger window |
| Effectively unlimited | `max_calls_per_window=0` | Rate limiting disabled for route |

**Short window + low count** vs **long window + high count:**

- Short windows (e.g., 5s / 5 calls) aggressively block bursts but reset
  quickly, allowing another burst immediately after.
- Long windows (e.g., 3600s / 100 calls) smooth traffic over time but a
  burst at window-start consumes all capacity until the window expires.

Choose based on whether you need burst suppression (short) or sustained
throughput limiting (long).

#### Gotchas

- **Windows are not aligned across routes or callers.** Each `(route, caller)`
  window starts independently on first call, so two callers can be in different
  phases of their windows simultaneously.
- **A network halt extends the effective window.** If the Stellar network
  halts for 10 minutes, `now` jumps forward by the halt duration when it
  resumes. Any caller whose window had not yet expired will suddenly find
  their window expired, resetting the counter immediately on the next call.
- **Changing `max_calls` takes effect immediately without resetting counters.**
  If you lower `max_calls_per_window` from 100 to 10 and a caller has already
  made 15 calls in the current window, they will be blocked until the window
  expires — even though those calls were made under the old config.
- **`window_seconds = 0` with `max_calls_per_window > 0` is rejected** by
  `configure_route` with `InvalidConfig`. Set `max_calls_per_window = 0` to
  disable rate limiting entirely.

**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`, `InvalidDelay`

---

### `queue(proposer, description, target, delay: u64, depends_on: Vec<u64>) → Result<u64, TimelockError>`
Queues a new operation. Returns the operation ID. `delay` must be >= `min_delay`. `depends_on` lists operation IDs that must execute first.

## router-quote

**Contract:** `RouterQuote`  
**Purpose:** Price quoting for token swaps — calculates expected output amounts, fees, and exchange rates without executing transactions.

### `get_quote(plugin, route_name, token_in, token_out, amount_in, fee_bps, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`

Gets a single-hop quote from a liquidity plugin. Returns expected output, fees, exchange rate, and price impact.

**Parameters:**
- `plugin` - Address of the liquidity plugin contract
- `route_name` - Route identifier
- `token_in` - Input token address
- `token_out` - Output token address
- `amount_in` - Amount to swap (must be > 0)
- `fee_bps` - Protocol fee in basis points
- `slippage_bps` - Slippage tolerance in basis points (0–10000)
- `precision` - Decimal places for exchange rate (1–18, typically 6)

**Errors:** `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `QuoteFailed`, `RouteNotFound`

---

### `get_multihop_quote(hops, amount_in, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`

Gets a multi-hop quote chaining multiple liquidity plugins. Returns end-to-end exchange rate and per-hop breakdown.

**Parameters:**
- `hops` - Ordered list of `HopDescriptor` (1–5 hops)
- `amount_in` - Initial input amount (must be > 0)
- `slippage_bps` - Slippage tolerance applied to final output (0–10000)
- `precision` - Decimal places for end-to-end exchange rate (1–18)

**Errors:** `EmptyRoute`, `RouteTooLong`, `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `QuoteFailed`

### Exchange Rate Precision and Rounding

The `exchange_rate` field uses **fixed-point arithmetic** to represent decimal values as integers, avoiding floating-point precision issues on-chain.

#### Formula

```
exchange_rate = (amount_out * 10^precision) / amount_in
```

#### Precision Values

- **Range:** 1–18 decimal places
- **Typical value:** 6 (supports micro-precision)
- **Configured per-quote:** Caller specifies precision when requesting a quote

#### Converting to Decimal

To convert the fixed-point `exchange_rate` to a decimal value:

```
decimal_rate = exchange_rate / 10^precision
```

**Examples:**
- `exchange_rate = 2_000_000`, `precision = 6` → `2.000000`
- `exchange_rate = 1_050_000`, `precision = 6` → `1.050000`
- `exchange_rate = 200`, `precision = 2` → `2.00`

#### Rounding Behavior

The calculation uses **integer division**, which **truncates (rounds down)** toward zero. This is deterministic and avoids banker's rounding or floating-point ambiguity.

**Example with truncation:**
```
amount_in = 3
amount_out = 10
precision = 6

exchange_rate = (10 * 1_000_000) / 3 = 3_333_333
decimal_rate = 3.333333 (truncated from 3.333333...)
```

#### Token Decimal Considerations

When working with tokens that have different decimal places:

1. **Token amounts** are in the token's native units (e.g., 1 USDC = 1_000_000 units for 6 decimals)
2. **Exchange rate precision** is independent of token decimals — it controls the rate's decimal representation
3. **Conversion example:**
   - Token A has 6 decimals, Token B has 18 decimals
   - Swap 1_000_000 Token A (1.0 Token A) for 5_000_000_000_000_000_000 Token B (5.0 Token B)
   - With `precision = 6`: `exchange_rate = (5_000_000_000_000_000_000 * 10^6) / 1_000_000 = 5_000_000_000_000_000`
   - Decimal rate: `5.0` (5 Token B per 1 Token A)

#### Best Practices

- Use `precision = 6` for most use cases (micro-precision)
- Use higher precision (12–18) for high-value or low-decimal tokens
- Always check the `precision` field when interpreting `exchange_rate`
- Account for truncation when calculating expected outputs client-side

## Error Code Reference

Each contract defines its own `#[contracterror]` enum. Use the tables below as the canonical error-code reference for integration, monitoring, and client-side handling.

### router-core (`RouterError`)

| Error | Code | When it occurs | How to handle |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `AlreadyInitialized` | `1` | `initialize` is called after admin/state already exists | Treat as idempotent setup; skip re-initialization and proceed with existing deployment |
| `NotInitialized` | `2` | Admin-gated write methods run before first initialization | Initialize the contract first, then retry |
| `Unauthorized` | `3` | Caller is not current admin for admin-only methods | Re-submit with admin signer or transfer admin before retry |
| `RouteNotFound` | `4` | Route (or alias target) does not exist for lookup/update/remove | Register route first, or correct the route/alias name |
| `RoutePaused` | `5` | `resolve` is called for a route marked paused | Unpause that route, or route traffic to another available route |
| `RouterPaused` | `6` | Router is globally paused during `resolve`/route selection | Unpause globally before serving traffic |
| `RouteAlreadyExists` | `7` | Registering route or alias that conflicts with existing route/alias | Use a unique name, or update/remove existing entry first |
