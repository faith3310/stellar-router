# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `router-core`: routes can now be registered with an optional TTL via `register_route_with_ttl`. `resolve()` returns `RouteExpired` once the current ledger exceeds a route's expiry, `get_all_routes()` excludes expired routes, and `extend_route_ttl` lets the admin extend a route's TTL before it expires. `get_route_expiry` returns a route's expiry ledger, if any. Routes registered without a TTL remain permanent.
- `router-access`: blacklist entries can now include an optional `reason` and an `expires_at` timestamp. Expired blacklist entries are treated as not blacklisted.
- `router-registry`: `ContractEntry` includes an optional `deprecation_reason` and the `deprecate()` API accepts an optional reason which is emitted in the `contract_deprecated` event.
- `metrics/alerts.yml`: example Prometheus alerting rules for circuit breaker opens, high failure/error rates, and high request volume.
